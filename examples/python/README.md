# Tintri REST API Python Examples
API version v310.53 maps to TXOS 4.2.1.x and TGC 3.0.1.x.

These code examples all use the library tintri_1_1.py.

The examples show how to:
- generate reports
- use service groups
- manipulate QoS
- take snapshots
- set configuration
- obtain statistics
- get recommendations for scale-out

*Note:* These are examples and they might not work in your environment.
