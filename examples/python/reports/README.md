The Python script, get\_vm\_report.py downloads a CSV report on VMs. This script
takes a CSV input file that controls which columns are in the report. 

There are 2 input CSV files, a template and and example. The template file,
vm\_report\_fields.csv, contains all the valid fields or columns that be included in
the VM report. Each line in the file contains the field name and a short
